```{r}
#Objects in R
#five 'atomic' classes of objects
#1. character
#2. numeric (same as float)
#3. integer
#4. complex
#5. logical

#vector, one of the most simple objects
#vectors can only contain one type of data, but LISTS can have different types of data (lists are represented as vectors)

#empty vectors can be made with vector(data_type, vector_length)
x <- vector('numeric', length = 10)

#c() makes vector objects

x <- c(.5, .6) ## numeric
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE) ## logical
x <- c(T, F) #logical
x <- c('a', 'b', 'c') #character
x <- 9:29 #integer
x <- x(1+0i, 2+4i) #complex
